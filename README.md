## About the Project

This daughter project of SimpleSubscribe contains code that you upload to an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda receives a trigger event from your RSS feed, and uses this data to send emails to your subscriber list stored in Dynamo DB.

For building your own independent subscriber base, see the [SimpleSubscribe project](https://github.com/victoriadrake/simple-subscribe).

## Getting Started

1. [Create a Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-create-function.html) to house RSS Mailer.
2. Create a `.env` file. See below for values.
3. Upload the function code. If your env is set up, you can run `make update`.
4. Set up your trigger to provide the expected arguments. See below.

### Environment Values

Your `.env` is used by the helper scripts and provides an easy way to upload Lambda environment variables. Here's an example of the expected values that you can customize for your needs:

```text
FUNCTION_NAME="rss-mailer"

LAMBDA_ENV="Variables={\
DB_TABLE_NAME=SimpleSubscribeList,\
UNSUBSCRIBE_LINK=https://example.com/api/unsubscribe/,\
WEBSITE=https://example.com,\
TITLE='My Newsletter Title',\
SENDER_EMAIL=no-reply@example.com,\
SENDER_NAME='Arthur Dent'}"
```

### Expected Arguments

The function's `Invocation` struct shows the arguments expected to be passed in from the trigger event. These are:

- `Title`: The title of an RSS item.
- `Description`: A description of an RSS item.
- `Content`: The main content of the item, usually HTML formatted.
- `Plain`: A plain-text version of the content.
- `Link`: A link to the item on the web.

If, for example, you're using Zapier to trigger your function, ensure that each of these arguments are provided in the **Invoke Function in AWS Lambda** > **Set up action** step.
